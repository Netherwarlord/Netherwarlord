Hi, I'm Christopher! 👋
IT Professional | Systems Administrator | Lifelong Learner

<p>
I'm a passionate IT professional with a love for building and managing technology from the ground up. My journey into advanced systems administration began during my time as an IT Support Technician, where I acquired my first enterprise-grade server, an HPE ProLiant DL380P Gen8. That single piece of hardware ignited my passion for creating a full-fledged homelab, which has become my personal playground for testing, learning, and deploying real-world IT solutions.

💡 About Me

I believe in practical, hands-on learning. My lab isn't just for show; it's a constantly evolving environment where I manage containerized services with Docker, administer Linux systems, and even run a sophisticated local AI development workflow. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's migrating a service from Nextcloud to Odoo for better project management or configuring a Samba share to serve as a high-performance game library for my Windows machine.

🚀 My Current Learning Journey

I am committed to continuous improvement and am actively developing a comprehensive, modern skill set. Right now, my focus is on:

🎓 Google IT Professional Certificate

☁️ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

💻 Codecademy Pro Career Paths: Full-Stack Engineering & Data Science
